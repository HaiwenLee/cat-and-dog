# cat-and-dog
A deep learning project, distinguish pictures of cats from pictures of dogs.

This is an easy deep-learing project based on convolutional neural network(CNN). Here are 80 pictures for train and 6 pictures for test. I don't have much fucking time and this project is just wrote for fun. All pictures were got from the website and the dataset was too small. Also, the loss function should be cross entropy loss while I used MSE loss, and I'm too lazy to change that.

There are many things worth improving in this project. And I think despite how poorly this project is executed, it still has some aspects worth considering. Hope it's helpful to you.
